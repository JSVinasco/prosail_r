#' Spectral response function (SRF) for Sentinel-2A
#'
#' @format A list including
#'  - *Spectral_Response*: the SRF of each spectral band of the sensor for a spectral domain compatible with PROSAIL
#'  - *Spectral_Bands*: the spectral bands of the sensor (i.e. wavelength or name of teh band as character)
#'  - *OriginalBands*: original spectral bands for which SRF is defined (compatible with PROSAIL == 1 nm spectral sampling)
