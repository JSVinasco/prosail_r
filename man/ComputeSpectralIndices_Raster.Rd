\title{this function aims at computing spectral indices from Sensor reflectance data in raster object
it computes the spectral indices based on their computation with Sentinel-2
and assumes that the bands of the S2 data follow this order
wavelength	= {496.6, 560.0, 664.5, 703.9, 740.2, 782.5, 835.1, 864.8, 1613.7, 2202.4}

\item{SensorBands}{numeric. wavelength in nanometers of the spectral bands of Refl.}

\item{Sel_Indices}{list. list of spectral indices to be computed}

\item{StackOut}{logical. If TRUE returns a stack, otherwise a list of rasters.}
}
\value{
list. includes
\itemize{
\item SpectralIndices: List of spectral indices computed from the reflectance initially provided
\item listIndices: list of spectral indices computable with the function
